        <h5>Safety in focus when Volvo Trucks and Renova test autonomous refuse truck<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span></h5>
        <p>Together with Swedish waste management company Renova, Volvo Trucks is currently testing and researching how automated vehicles can contribute to safer, more efficient refuse handling and create a better working environment for drivers. The automated systems being tested are in principle the same as those fitted to the autonomous Volvo truck operating in the Kristineberg Mine in northern Sweden since autumn 2016. </p>

        <h5>2017 Volvo Trucks Safety Report focuses on vulnerable road users <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span></h5>
        <p>The number of serious road accidents involving trucks is dropping, but the safety of vulnerable road users must be improved. And there are still far too few truck drivers who use their seat belts. These are among the findings of a new traffic safety report from Volvo Trucks. </p>

        <h5>Intelligent safety systems to minimise risk of traffic accidents <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span></h5>
        <p>More vehicles on the roads, a faster traffic flow and a distracting stream of information all impose considerable demands on both commercial vehicle drivers and car drivers. On the other hand, there has never been more opportunities for the person behind the wheel to drive more safely than there is today. The active safety systems found in many modern cars and trucks make it far easier to avoid incidents and accidents. </p>
